## TODO

- [x] SUN + REFLECTION
- [x] Stars + Reflection
- [ ] CLOUDS
- [ ] Mountains
- [ ] Stars colour gradient to blend vs opacity
- [ ] BIRDS (animated, parametric equation for their path)
- [ ] Animations
	- [ ] Stars flicker
	- [ ] Sun reflection in the water
	- [ ] Waves on water
	- [ ] Waves on shore

- [ ] Buildings variations
	- [ ] In blocks? i.e. floor sections?

- [ ] Sci-fi elements
	- [ ] Space ships
	- [ ] additional planets
	- [ ] space debris
	- [ ] Star rings

Things like gradients, color palettes, shapes, the way certain things create their geometry (e.g. "ground" being just a sloped line faking perspective or something) should all be pluggable components.

I'd like to have a library of gradients for example I'll just be able to select from, and a "GradientPicker" component would have config of how many steps to select colours at etc.
